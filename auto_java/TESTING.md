###Bugs found during test execution

GET endpoint (TestFooGet failing on the last Scenario)
- The documentation doesn't explain which message should be returned when status code is 501 from GET.
- It isnÂ´t allow double as input, if you introduce a double is managed like an integer.

POST endpoint (TestFooPost should be pass all scenarios)
